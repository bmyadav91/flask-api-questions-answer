    "# Add version as a query parameter: Include a version query parameter in the URL, e.g., /api/users?version=2.\n",
    "# Advantages: Similar to header-based versioning, doesn't affect URLs.\n",
    "# Disadvantages: Can be less readable and may expose version information to the public.\n",

    "# Fixed window: A simple approach where the rate limit is applied over a fixed time window.\n",
